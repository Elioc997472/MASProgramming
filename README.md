# Reservation App

We built an app that lets users reserve a block of 2 hours during the day for personal use. Once a timeslot is reserved, it becomes unavailable for other logged-in users, ensuring that the schedules donâ€™t overlap. This feature is primarily useful for managing access to shared amenities like laundry machines, and kitchen areas for roommates.
